                            <p>Within the specification of my A-Level product design course, I had to conduct my own research surrounding the concept of my product. I chose to research into bike stands by visiting the bike shop JJames Cycles. It helped going into the shop because I got to see and understand how I could improve my product.</p>

                                    <p>This first product that I found at JJames was holding up several bikes on a wall. This product consisted of three parts firstly on part was a slot shaped part that was fixed into the wall where the pedal was hooked up. The other two parts were shelf like parts which held the bottom of each bike wheel. These two parts are not fixed into anything and are able to hold the product up and at an angle which is easy to get off.</p>

                                    <p>This second product is a part of a set of stands which have two different levels to them, but I photographed only one part for one bike. This one part consists of a long-curved metal bar which has metal swing/fencing along side it to hold the whole bike and reach the length of the whole bike. The second part of it is a metal bar which reaches up and holds at the bottom bracket which is where the pedals go in.</p>

                                <div class="technical-description">
                                    <p>This last product is a bit more complicated than the other ones because of the mechanism behind it. This product consists of two parts, the first being the bit at the bottom which holds the wheel at the bottom and holds it off the ground. The second part is a bit which it is against the metal bar and the bottom part is a bracket which depending on the size the wheel.</p>

                                    <p>I think that even though its good just describing the products could you have asked more detailed questions to the workers to get more information?</p>

                                    <p>The research I need to carry on is looking at wheel sizes to see how big to make the wheel holder and see what type of holder I can make.</p>
